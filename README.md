# ✈️ Union Airways – Goal Programming Staffing Optimization

This project applies a **Goal Programming Model** to determine optimal staffing levels for Union Airways across multiple shifts and time periods. The model evaluates three scenarios:

- **Scenario 1 – Optimal Solution**
- **Scenario 2 – Understated Minimum Staffing (-30%)**
- **Scenario 3 – Overstated Maximum Staffing (+30%)**

Using Excel Solver, the model calculates:
- Minimum agents needed  
- Cost per shift  
- Total daily cost  
- Staffing trade-offs across scenarios
